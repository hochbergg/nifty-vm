# Eager loading makes it so that you can load all associated records for a
# set of objects in a single query, instead of a separate query for each object.
#
# Two separate implementations are provided.  #eager should be used most of the
# time, as it loads associated records using one query per association.  However,
# it does not allow you the ability to filter based on columns in associated tables.  #eager_graph loads
# all records in one query.  Using #eager_graph you can filter based on columns in associated
# tables.  However, #eager_graph can be much slower than #eager, especially if multiple
# *_to_many associations are joined.
#
# You can cascade the eager loading (loading associations' associations)
# with no limit to the depth of the cascades.  You do this by passing a hash to #eager or #eager_graph
# with the keys being associations of the current model and values being
# associations of the model associated with the current model via the key.
#  
# The arguments can be symbols or hashes with symbol keys (for cascaded
# eager loading). Examples:
#
#   Album.eager(:artist).all
#   Album.eager_graph(:artist).all
#   Album.eager(:artist, :genre).all
#   Album.eager_graph(:artist, :genre).all
#   Album.eager(:artist).eager(:genre).all
#   Album.eager_graph(:artist).eager(:genre).all
#   Artist.eager(:albums=>:tracks).all
#   Artist.eager_graph(:albums=>:tracks).all
#   Artist.eager(:albums=>{:tracks=>:genre}).all
#   Artist.eager_graph(:albums=>{:tracks=>:genre}).all

  # Add the #eager! and #eager_graph! mutation methods to the dataset.
  def self.extended(obj)
    obj.def_mutation_method(:eager, :eager_graph)
  end

  # The preferred eager loading method.  Loads all associated records using one
  # query for each association.
  #
  # The basic idea for how it works is that the dataset is first loaded normally.
  # Then it goes through all associations that have been specified via eager.
  # It loads each of those associations separately, then associates them back
  # to the original dataset via primary/foreign keys.  Due to the necessity of
  # all objects being present, you need to use .all to use eager loading, as it
  # can't work with .each.
  #
  # This implementation avoids the complexity of extracting an object graph out
  # of a single dataset, by building the object graph out of multiple datasets,
  # one for each association.  By using a separate dataset for each association,
  # it avoids problems such as aliasing conflicts and creating cartesian product
  # result sets if multiple *_to_many eager associations are requested.
  #
  # One limitation of using this method is that you cannot filter the dataset
  # based on values of columns in an associated table, since the associations are loaded
  # in separate queries.  To do that you need to load all associations in the
  # same query, and extract an object graph from the results of that query. If you
  # need to filter based on columns in associated tables, look at #eager_graph
  # or join the tables you need to filter on manually. 
  #
  # Each association's order, if definied, is respected. Eager also works
  # on a limited dataset, but does not use any :limit options for associations.
  # If the association uses a block or has an :eager_block argument, it is used.

  # The secondary eager loading method.  Loads all associations in a single query. This
  # method should only be used if you need to filter based on columns in associated tables.
  #
  # This method builds an object graph using Dataset#graph.  Then it uses the graph
  # to build the associations, and finally replaces the graph with a simple array
  # of model objects.
  #
  # Be very careful when using this with multiple *_to_many associations, as you can
  # create large cartesian products.  If you must graph multiple *_to_many associations,
  # make sure your filters are specific if you have a large database.
  # 
  # This does not respect each association's order, as all associations are loaded in
  # a single query.  If you want to order the results, you must manually call .order.
  #
  # #eager_graph probably won't work correctly on a limited dataset, unless you are
  # only graphing many_to_one associations.
  # 
  # Does not use the block defined for the association, since it does a single query for
  # all objects.  You can use the :graph_join_type, :graph_conditions, and :graph_join_table_conditions
  # association options to modify the SQL query.
